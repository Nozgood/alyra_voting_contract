# Voting

This project has been proposed by Alyra School (<https://www.alyra.fr/>)
It contains a smart contract allowing you to create voting sessions with:

- partipants registering (via their addresses)
- proposals registering (only if you are a participant)
- vote for your favorite proposal
- picking of the most voted proposal and consulting of this proposal
